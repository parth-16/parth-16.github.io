            <h2>🔍 Hospital Readmission Analysis</h2>
            <p><strong>Uncovering patterns in patient readmissions using SQL-based data analysis.</strong></p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>📌 Introduction</h3>
            <p>Hospital readmissions are a major challenge in healthcare, leading to increased costs and patient risks. 
               This project examines hospital readmission data to identify key factors contributing to high readmission rates, 
               enabling better decision-making for patient care and hospital management.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>🎯 Key Objectives</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Analyze hospital readmission trends based on <strong>age, gender, discharge destinations, and medical conditions</strong>.</li>
                <li>Assess the <strong>impact of diabetes medications</strong> on patient readmissions.</li>
                <li>Utilize advanced <strong>SQL techniques</strong> to derive meaningful insights from healthcare data.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>📊 Data Overview</h3>
            <p>The dataset consists of thousands of hospital admission records, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Patient demographics:</strong> Age, gender, race.</li>
                <li> <strong>Admission details:</strong> Type, source, time in hospital.</li>
                <li> <strong>Medical history:</strong> Diagnoses, procedures, medications.</li>
                <li> <strong>Treatment details:</strong> Diabetes medication usage, insulin prescriptions.</li>
                <li> <strong>Readmission status:</strong> Patients readmitted within 30 days vs. beyond 30 days.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>🛠 Data Processing</h3>
            <p>The dataset required extensive preprocessing before analysis, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Handling Missing Data:</strong> Columns with excessive missing values (e.g., "weight", "payer_code") were dropped, while others were filled with appropriate values (e.g., "Unknown" for categorical variables).</li>
                <li> <strong>Data Standardization:</strong> Categorical variables like "Gender" were standardized (e.g., merging variations like "M", "Male").</li>
                <li> <strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Admission sources, diagnoses, and medications were grouped for better interpretability.</li>
                <li> <strong>SQL-Based Processing:</strong> Used **CTEs, window functions, and aggregations** to optimize queries and improve insights.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>✅ Conclusion & Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Older patients & chronic disease patients have higher readmission risks. Hospitals should focus on post-discharge monitoring.</li>
                <li> Patients on insulin require closer follow-up, as they show significantly higher readmissions.</li>
                <li> Emergency admissions & hospital transfers show the highest readmission risks.</li>
                <li> Improving post-discharge care in SNFs & hospitals can reduce readmission rates.</li>
